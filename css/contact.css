/* In the past, we have always used fixed sized images. When we are 
   designing a professional site that will work on mobile devices
   the images will sometimes change sizes. So for the background header
   image, we need a very wide image. 

   Header image > 1500px wide 

   Some of the top and bottom will be cropped off, so you must use 
   an image that does not require seeing everything */
