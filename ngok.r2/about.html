		<p>For a long time I have wanted to improve how people communicate with friends and
		family. The ability to video chat and multi task while using smart phones has opened up
		many more possibilities for communication and general use of our phones.  However, it can
		be challenging to use these devices hands-free. It is not always easy to prop your phone 
		at the appropriate angle while keeping it stabile.</p>

		<p>The Ngok phone case is intended to solve this issue. The most important thing about 
		the Ngok is that it is truly convenient, compact, and an execellent solution for people 
		who want to use their hands while accessing their smart phone.</p>

		<p>The current design for the Ngok was the result of extensive experimentation and testing 
		of over 30 different prototypes to find the most functional design that utilized the best
		ergonomics. After many designs were dismissed and re-visualized, I found one that incorporates
		all of the elements needed to make your smart device the best tool for communication and 
		other uses.</p>

		<p>Having found the right design, I began to research how to mass produce the Ngok, making it
		available to the general public. My findings indicate that it could potentially cost as much
		as $150,000 for the tools, equipment, and other elements necessary for the production of the
		Ngok. As I am currently unable to fund this myself, I decided to reach out to the community
		for your support.</p>

		<p>Please consider making a donation today to help me make the Ngok available for everyone!</p>
