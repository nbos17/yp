          <h4>Introducing Yan's Place: Creative Design & Technology Solutions</h4>
        

          <p>Yan's Place is a business that I, Yan, have created. My background in graphic design and photography inspired its inception 
		  and development. This website showcases my original technology solutions, creative designs and artworks. Yan's Place is currently 
		  working on two main projects: The Ngok Design Case with Stand and Fine Art & Stock Photography.</p>

          <h4>Technology Solutions: The Ngok</h4>

          <p>Yan's Place is currently undertaking the production of a new protective case I invented for smart devices. The Ngok Design Case with Stand 
		  began as a solution to use video chat services on my phone, hands-free. It helps users prop up their phone in a stabile position while watching 
		  videos or communicating with friends and family. We are extremely excited about the results of the prototypes; and are currently seeking 
		  support to help us mass produce the Ngok for widespread use.</p>

          <h4>Creative Design: Fine Art & Stock Photography</h4>

          <p>I have always had a passion for visual and creative arts. This interest inspired me to explore photography, painting, and drawing. 
		  Currently, my main focus is creating abstract print photography. The Fine Art & Stock photography you will find here are all original 
		  pieces created by me; available for purchase through my website.</p>

        <h4>About Yan: Business Professional & Artist</h4>

        <p>As a young child living in Hong Kong. I had the opportunity to meet Queen Elizabeth II during one of her visits. I was called upon to 
		represent the orphanage I was a part of as a young child. This made an impression upon me at a very young age.</p>
		
		<p>Later in my young life I was adopted by an American family from Massachusetts. While living there I attended a school with a Catholic 
		Church next door. The Priest met with me and a few of my classmates on a regular basis; teaching us about God, Jesus Christ, life, and Catholicism. 
		This is where my faith began to develop and flourish. I regularly remember taking in the beautiful colors and images from the stained glass windows 
		in the church during our meetings.</p>

        <p>Throughout grade school, I was asked every year to create artwork to sell in the school fundraiser. This involvement continued into high school, 
		when I began to consider career and college options. Upon graduating, I moved to Minnesota where I attended college and earned a degree in Commercial Art.</p>

        <p>I've held various jobs as a graphic and illustrative designer which provided ample learning opportunities. During this time I married and had two 
		children. In 2006, I decided to explore other employment options, at which time I decided to start my own business in Fine Art & Stock Photography. 
		Yan's Place was officially established in the year 2009 and by 2011 the idea for the Ngok Design Case with Stand was born.</p>

        <h4>About the Ngok Design Case with Stand</h4>

        <p>Smart devices are integrated into every part our lives. We can make phone calls, take and make videos, browse the internet, watch TV shows and 
		movies, upload, download, listen to music, set alarms, and even control our home's locks and thermostat from our phones. Our cell phones and tablets 
		have become a part of not only our lives, but how we live them.</p>
		
		<p>Due to the popularity and frequency we use these devices, our bodies are starting to suffer. We're becoming a population of people with "tech neck". 
		Hunched over, hands up, eyes down, thumbs moving rapidly. What will happen to us that use these devices? Are we doomed to be hunchbacks for the rest 
		of our years? With the advancement of technology, the accessories that go with our devices must have upgraded? Something must have been developed to 
		prevent us from having back and neck problems for the rest of our lives? But unless you want to carry another inconvenient accessory they haven't.</p>

        <p>Introducing the Ngok Designer Case with Stand; not only does it protect your smart device but it also protects your neck and back. It improves the way we use 
		our device to move us from "tech neck" to a natural ergonomic position. It gives us the best of both worlds. We now can do all the things we need to do 
		and enjoy about our smart device, but now in a smart way. Leaving us upright and hands-free; releasing us from a future of being hunched over and in pain.</p>

        <p>With the Ngok's built-in stand, it can setup both vertically and horizontally virtually anywhere in seconds, giving you the view you need; allowing 
		your arms, neck, back, and hands to return to a natural posture. No extra accessories to carry around; convenient, sleek, stable and easy.</p>
		

		<p>Your ideal mobile companion, the Ngok Designer Case with Stand.
